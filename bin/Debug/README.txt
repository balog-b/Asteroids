Welcome to Asteroids!
W and S to wrap around the menu, Enter to select
W to accelerate, A and D to turn, and Space to shoot.
Hitting asteroids or the edge of the screen will blow you up (yes, I know, in the original you could warp from one side to another)
Shooting asteroids will give you points. Just surviving will give you points too. Playing on harder difficulties will give you more points
Have fun!
